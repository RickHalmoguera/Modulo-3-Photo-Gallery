## Features

This site was created as a submission to the Training in [Oxygen Academy](https://oxygenacademy.es/). Where we practice the following points:

- Practicing React folders structure.
- Usage of Routes from React Router.
- Sending and requesting data from an API.
- Using LocalStorage inside the store with Redux.

We can observe these practices in the following features:

- A Nav bar that displays the two routes in this App.
- Search Bar for calls to the API.
- Add to favorites photos.
- Download posibility.
- Manipulation of the favorites photos, like sorting, removing photos or editing description.
